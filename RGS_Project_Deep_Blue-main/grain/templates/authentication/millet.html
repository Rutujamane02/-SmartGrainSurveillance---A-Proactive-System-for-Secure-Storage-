    <h1>Indian Millets: Nutrition, Production, and Benefits</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction to Indian Millets</h2>
    <p>Indian millets are a group of nutritiously rich, drought-tolerant, small-seeded grasses that are mostly grown in the arid and semi-arid regions of India. Belonging to the botanical family Poaceae, millets are an important source of food and fodder for millions of resource-poor farmers and contribute to India's ecological and economic security. Often referred to as "coarse cereals" or "cereals of the poor", Indian millets are nutritionally superior to wheat and rice, being rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals. They are gluten-free and have a low glycemic index, making them ideal for people with celiac disease or diabetes.</p>

            <h2>Millet Export and Production</h2>
            <p>India is among the top 5 exporters of millets in the world. According to the ITC Trade Map, the global export of millet increased from $400 million in 2020 to $470 million in 2021. India exported millets worth $64.28 million in the year 2021-22, an increase from $59.75 million in 2020-21. Despite these numbers, millet-based value-added products contribute negligibly to this growth.</p>
            <p>India is also the largest producer and exporter of cereal products worldwide. In 2021-22, India's cereal export reached Rs. 96,011.42 Crore (12,872.64 USD Millions), with rice taking a dominant 75% share of the export value. Millets and other cereals, however, constitute a smaller portion of this total.</p>

            <h2>Health Benefits of Millets</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Highly adaptive to a wide range of ecological conditions, including rain-fed and arid climates.</li>
                <li>Require minimal water, fertilizers, and pesticides.</li>
                <li>Rich in micronutrients like iron, zinc, and calcium.</li>
                <li>Low Glycemic Index (GI), beneficial for diabetes prevention.</li>
                <li>Gluten-free, ideal for celiac disease patients.</li>
                <li>Helpful in managing hyperlipidemia, reducing risk of cardiovascular diseases.</li>
                <li>Contributes to weight loss, reduction of BMI, and blood pressure management.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Millet Production in India</h2>
    <p>Millet is a popular grain in many parts of the world, particularly Africa and Asia, where it serves as a staple food. The World Food Programme estimates that 1.2 billion people consume millet regularly. India, the largest millet producer, has seen a rise in millet production, thanks in part to the government's promotion of millet farming as part of the National Food Security Mission. In 2020, global millet production stood at 28 million metric tons, with India, Niger, and China leading production.</p>
    
    <h2>Indian Millet Sourcing Points</h2>
    <p>The primary millet-growing states in India include Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. These states contribute significantly to both domestic and international millet markets. Smaller millet-producing regions include Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh, further bolstering India's millet supply chain.</p>
