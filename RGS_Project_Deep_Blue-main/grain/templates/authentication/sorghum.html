    <h2 class="section-title">1. Description</h2>
    <p>Sorghum is a type of cereal grain that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is one of the top five cereal crops in the world, widely grown in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Sorghum is a tall, erect, annual grass that typically grows to a height of 1-2 meters. It has long, narrow leaves and produces large, compact clusters of grain on top of its stems. The grains are small, round, and have a hard outer layer that is difficult to remove. Sorghum plants come in various colors, such as red, brown, white, and yellow, with some varieties being sweet.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Uses & Benefits</h3>
    <p>Sorghum is a versatile grain used in food production, animal feed, and industrial applications. It can be used to make porridge, bread, and snacks, and its flour is gluten-free, making it popular in gluten-free baking. Sorghum is also used in brewing beer, producing biofuels, and making biodegradable packaging. It is rich in antioxidants and essential nutrients, contributing to health benefits such as improved digestion and cardiovascular health.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">2. Varieties</h2>
    <p>Sorghum has several varieties suited for different uses, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grain sorghum (milo)</strong> - used for food, animal feed, and biofuel.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweet sorghum</strong> - high sugar content, used for syrups and sweeteners.</li>
        <li><strong>Forage sorghum</strong> - primarily for animal feed.</li>
        <li><strong>Broomcorn sorghum</strong> - used for making brooms and brushes.</li>
        <li><strong>Dual-purpose sorghum</strong> - grown for both grain and forage.</li>
        <li><strong>High-tannin sorghum</strong> - resistant to pests and birds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">3. Propagation</h2>
    <p>Sorghum grows in various soil and climate conditions. It prefers warm weather, requires well-drained soil, and is drought-tolerant. Planting time and spacing are crucial for optimal growth. Sorghum can be grown by direct seeding or transplanting and requires careful management of soil nutrients and water.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">4. Common Pests and Diseases</h2>
    <div class="diseases">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anthracnose (Colletotrichum graminicola)</strong>: Small red lesions on leaves and stems. Management: plant resistant varieties, remove susceptible plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Charcoal rot (Macrophomina phaseolina)</strong>: Dark gray stalks, shredded tissue. Management: plant in fertile soil, irrigate during drought.</li>
            <li><strong>Gray leaf spot (Cercospora sorghi)</strong>: Red spots form rectangular lesions. Management: plant resistant varieties.</li>
            <li><strong>Rough spot (Ascochyta sorghi)</strong>: Red spots on leaves, sandpaper texture. Management: plant resistant varieties.</li>
            <li><strong>Smut (Sporisorium sorghi)</strong>: Head replaced by fungal spores. Management: resistant varieties, apply fungicides.</li>
            <li><strong>Zonate leaf spot (Gloeocercospora sorghi)</strong>: Concentric red and purple bands. Management: crop rotation, field sanitation.</li>
        </ul>
