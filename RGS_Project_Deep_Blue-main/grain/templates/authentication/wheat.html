                Wheat cultivation in India has traditionally been dominated by the northern region of India. The northern states of Punjab and Haryana Plains in India have been prolific wheat producers. While this cereal grass has been studied carefully in the past, recent years of painstaking research by India's finest scientific talent have paid off with the development of distinctly superior varieties of Durum Wheat.

            <h2>Durum Wheat</h2>
            <p>
                This hard wheat is cultivated in clayey soil and is highly sought after for its physical characteristics. Its high gluten strength and uniform golden color make it ideal for bread making and pasta preparation, unlike the softer commercially high-yielding wheat, which lacks the strength and consistency of durum. Today, India is exporting sufficient quantities of all types of wheat and extensive research efforts are underway for improving its cereals and grain output in the years to come.

While this cereal grass has been studied carefully in the past, recent years of painstaking research by India's finest scientific talent have paid off with the development of distinctly superior varieties of Durum Wheat. With production reaching ten times in the past five years, India is today the second-largest wheat producer in the whole world.
